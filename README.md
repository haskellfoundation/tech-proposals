# Haskell Foundation Tech Proposals

[![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=Haskell%20Foundation&message=official&color=purple&style=for-the-badge)](https://haskell.foundation)

This repository is for the [Haskell Foundation](https://haskell.foundation) tech proposals. 

Haskell Foundation tech proposals are a means of adding items to the HF technical agenda, pending final review by the HF leadership.
Additionally, tech proposals are a means of soliciting broad feedback for technical and social initiatives that matter to the Haskell community.
This repository is maintained by the Haskell Foundation and its volunteers.
The tech proposal process is described at https://github.com/haskellfoundation/tech-proposals/blob/main/proposals/PROPOSALS.md
